## Post-project Review

This felt more like a regular lesson with a lab than a standalone project.

I initially read the day of the week with .wday, but the output was the index of the day of the week, which isn't really human readable. The project doesn't state what the output should be, but I wanted the actual name of the week, so I modified it a little.
